US-20060294622-A1.3626.868 Domain: Domains are fingerprints or signatures that can be used to characterize protein families and/or parts of proteins. Such fingerprints or signatures can comprise conserved (1) primary sequence, (2) secondary structure, and/or (3) three-dimensional conformation. Generally, each domain has been associated with either a family of proteins or motifs. Typically, these families and/or motifs have been correlated with specific in-vitro and/or in-vivo activities. A domain can be any length, including the entirety of the sequence of a protein. Detailed descriptions of the domains, associated families and motifs, and correlated activities of the polypeptides of the instant invention are described below. Usually, the polypeptides with designated domain(s) can exhibit at least one activity that is exhibited by any polypeptide that comprises the same domain(s).

US-20060294622-A1.5888.886Arabidopsis coding region sequence. Also, a promoter from a gene encoding a growth factor from corn is considered heterologous to a sequence encoding the corn receptor for the growth factor. Regulatory element sequences, such as UTRs or 3′ end termination sequences that do not originate in nature from the same gene as the coding sequence originates from, are considered heterologous to said coding sequence. Elements operatively linked in nature and contiguous to each other are not heterologous to each other. On the other hand, these same elements remain operatively linked but become heterologous if other filler sequence is placed between them. Thus, the promoter and coding sequences of a corn gene expressing an amino acid transporter are not heterologous to each other, but the promoter and coding sequence of a corn gene operatively linked in a novel manner are heterologous. 
US-20060294622-A1.6774.597 High pH: “High pH” can be defined as a non-optimal and terminal alkaline pH value when a given plant can no longer make use of certain essential nutrients, such as phosphate, available in the soil. For instance, if a plant grows optimally at pH of 4.0-5.0, high pH would be any pH greater than 5. If the optimal pH were in the range of 6-6.5, high pH would be a pH greater than pH 6.5. As an example, if a corn crop under optimal pH conditions would yield 134 bushels per acre and all other conditions were held constant, a high pH tolerant variety would produce similar yields at pH 9 or above. 
US-20060294622-A1.7371.191Plant J. 8:37 (1995)). Examples of environmental conditions that may affect transcription by inducible promoters include anaerobic conditions, elevated temperature, or the presence of light. 
US-20060294622-A1.7562.1379 Low Nitrogen: “Low nitrogen” can be defined as a quantity of nitrogen, whether in the form of ammonium or nitrate, which is insufficient to sustain normal growth and yield for a given plant. The need for nitrogen fertilizers varies considerably among plants. Further, the type of soil and the conditions in the soil have a significant impact on the ability of a plant to take up nitrogen. Supplemental nitrogen fertilizers are often added to soil or applied directly to plants to enhance their growth or appearance. Even with normal fertilizer applications, the amount of nitrogen available to a plant at any given time may be too low to support optimal growth. Hence, low nitrogen must be defined in terms of the specific plant and environment in which the plant is being grown. For example, if under a given set of conditions with a specific corn hybrid the optimal nitrogen level was 160 pounds of nitrogen fertilizer per acre and under such conditions the hybrid were able to achieve a yield of 134 bushels per acre, a low nitrogen tolerant hybrid would grow optimally and produce the same yield with at least 10% less or at least 20% less or at least 30% less or at least 40% less or at least 50% less nitrogen. Further, the low nitrogen hybrid would grow better after much of the initial nitrogen had been depleted and would not require multiple applications of nitrogen. 
US-20060294622-A1.8941.556 Low pH: “Low pH” can be defined as that non-optimal and terminal acidic pH value when a given plant can no longer make use of certain essential nutrients, such as potassium, available in the soil. If a plant grows optimally at pH of 4.0-5.0, low pH is any pH less than 4. If the optimal pH is in the range of 6-8, low pH would be a pH less than 6. For example, if a corn crop under optimal pH conditions would yield 134 bushels per acre and all other conditions were held constant, a low pH tolerant variety would produce similar yields at pH 5, or pH 4. 
US-20060294622-A1.9497.804 Low Phosphate: “Low phosphate” can be defined as a quantity of phosphate which is insufficient to sustain normal growth and yield for a given plant. The level of phosphate required for optimal plant growth differs among plant species and depends on the condition of the soil and other environmental conditions. To determine a level of phosphate that is low, comparative experiments are needed. For example, if a corn hybrid in a particular field treated with 40 pounds of phosphate per acre would yield 134 bushels per acre and all other conditions were held constant, a low phosphate tolerant hybrid would produce similar yields at 35 or less pounds of phosphate per acre or 30 or less pounds of phosphate per acre or 25 or less pounds of phosphate per acre or 20 or less pounds of phosphate per acre.

US-20060294622-A1.13826.872 The polynucleotides and polypeptides of the present invention are of interest because when they are misexpressed (i.e. when expressed at a non-natural location or in an increased or decreased amount) they produce plants with modified pH tolerance or phosphate use efficiency. “Phosphate use efficiency” is a term that includes various responses to environmental conditions that affect the amount of phosphate available to the plant. For example, under both low and high pH conditions phosphate is bound within the soil, resulting in a decrease of available phosphate for maintaining or initiating physiological processes. As used herein, modulating phosphate use efficiency is intended to encompass all of these situations as well as other environmental situations that affect the plant's ability to use and/or maintain phosphate effectively (e.g. osmotic stress, etc.). 
US-20060294622-A1.14698.765 The polynucleotides and polypeptides of the invention, as discussed below and as evidenced by the results of various experiments, are useful for modulating pH tolerance or phosphate use efficiency. These traits can be used to exploit or maximize plant products for agricultural, ornamental or forestry purposes in different environment conditions of water supply. Modulating the expression of the nucleotides and polypeptides of the present invention leads to transgenic plants that will be less sensitive to variations in pH and that require less phosphate, resulting in better yields under these types of adverse conditions. Both categories of transgenic plants lead to reduced costs for the farmer and better yield in their respective environmental conditions.

Such characteristics can include sequence similarity, biochemical activity and phenotypic activity. Typically, the functionally comparable proteins share some sequence similarity and generally share at least one biochemical and/or phenotypic activity. For example, biochemical functionally comparable proteins are proteins that act on the same reactant to give the same product. 
US-20060294622-A1.16203.371 Another class of functionally comparable proteins is phenotypic functionally comparable proteins. The members of this class regulate the same physical characteristic, such as increased drought tolerance. Proteins can be considered phenotypic functionally comparable proteins even if the proteins give rise to the same physical characteristic, but to a different degree. 
US-20060294622-A1.16574.567 The polypeptides of the invention also include those comprising the consensus sequences described in Tables 1-5, 2-6 and 3-5.

Conservative substitutes for an amino acid within the native polypeptide sequence can be selected from other members of the class to which the amino acid belongs (see below). Amino acids can be divided into the following four groups: (1) acidic (negatively charged) amino acids, such as aspartic acid and glutamic acid; (2) basic (positively charged) amino acids, such as arginine, histidine, and lysine; (3) neutral polar amino acids, such as glycine, serine, threonine, cysteine, cystine, tyrosine, asparagine, and glutamine; and (4) neutral nonpolar (hydrophobic) amino acids such as alanine, leucine, isoleucine, valine, proline, phenylalanine, tryptophan, and methionine.

The media pH is retested since pH values drop after autoclaving as follows: pH 5.7→pH 5.66; pH 7.03→pH6.50; pH 8.02→pH 7.50; pH 9.01→pH 8.91; pH10.18→pH 9.91. Generally speaking, pH 9.01(pH 8.91) allows germination but no growth beyond 2 to 5 mm and no root growth. Germination does not occur at higher pH (e.g. pH 10.81).

External wild-types were non-transgenic plants from an outside source which shared no lineage with the line being tested. External wild-types are added to the experiment as a process control to ensure the quality of the growth conditions. Average height for transgenic plants of cDNA 12482777 was 33.44 cm±0.78 versus 44.65 cm±0.70 for the internal wild-type controls. Despite this decrease in plant height, harvest index, as measured by seed weight/total plant weight remained unaffected, i.e., these transgenic plants still produced the same ratio of total seed weight:total plant weight (biomass) as non-transgenic controls. This result means that although the total seed yield is decreased in cDNA 12482777 lines, it still has the same seed proportionally as controls. The cDNA 12482777 plants had a harvest index of 56.96±2.99 compared to the wild-type population's harvest index of 44.92±2.67 (Table 3-2A).

US-20060294623-A1.1368.242 Senescence is the terminal phase of biological development in the life of a plant. It presages death and occurs at various levels of biological organization including the whole plant, organs, flowers and fruit, tissues and individual cells. 
US-20060294623-A1.1610.387 The onset of senescence can be induced by different factors both internal and external. Senescence is a complex, highly regulated developmental stage in the life of a plant or plant tissue, such as fruit, flowers and leaves. Senescence results in the coordinated breakdown of cell membranes and macromolecules and the subsequent mobilization of metabolites to other parts of the plant. 
US-20060294623-A1.1997.721 In addition to the programmed senescence which takes place during normal plant development, death of cells and tissues and ensuing remobilization of metabolites occurs as a coordinated response to external, environmental factors. External factors that induce premature initiation of senescence, which is also referred to as necrosis or apoptosis, include environmental stresses such as temperature, drought, poor light or nutrient supply, as well as pathogen attack. Plant tissues exposed to environmental stress also produce ethylene, commonly known as stress ethylene (Buchanan-Wollaston, V., 1997, J. Exp. Botany, 48:181-199; Wright, M., 1974, Plant, 120:63-69). Ethylene is known to cause senescence in some plants. 
US-20060294623-A1.2718.229Arabidopsis, maize, cucumber, asparagus, tomato, rice and potato. Identification of genes that are expressed specifically during senescence is hard evidence of the requirement for de novo transcription for senescence to proceed. 
US-20060294623-A1.2947.608 The events that take place during senescence appear to be highly coordinated to allow maximum use of the cellular components before necrosis and death occur. Complex interactions involving the perception of specific signals and the induction of cascades of gene expression must occur to regulate this process. Expression of genes encoding senescence related proteins is probably regulated via common activator proteins that are, in turn, activated directly or indirectly by hormonal signals. Little is known about the mechanisms involved in the initial signaling or subsequent co-ordination of the process. 
US-20060294623-A1.3555.1060 Coordinated gene expression requires factors involved in transcription and translation, including initiation factors. Translation initiation factor genes have been isolated and characterized in a variety of organisms, including plants. Translation initiation factors can control the rate at which mRNA populations are moved out of the nucleus, the rate at which they are associated with a ribosome and to some extent can affect the stability of specific mRNAs. (Zuk, et al., EMBO J. 17:2914-2925 (1998). Indeed, one such translation initiation factor, which is not required for global translation activity, is believed to shuttle specific subsets of mRNAs from the nucleus to the cytoplasm for translation. Jao, et al., J. Cell. Biochem. 86:590-600, (2002); Wang et al., J Biol Chem 276:17541-17549 (2001); Rosorius et al., J. Cell Sci., 112, 2369-2380 (1999). This translation factor is known as the eukaryotic initiation factor 5A (eIF-5A), and is the only protein known to contain the amino acid hypusine. Park, et al., J Biol Chem 263:15264-15269 (1988). 
US-20060294623-A1.4615.918 Eukaryotic translation initiation factor 5A (eIF-5A) is an essential protein factor approximately 17 KDa in size, which is involved in the initiation of eukaryotic cellular protein synthesis. It is characterized by the presence of hypusine [N-(4-amino-2-hydroxybutyl)lysine], a unique modified amino acid, known to be present only in eIF-5A. Hypusine is formed post-translationally via the transfer and hydroxylation of the butylamino group from the polyamine, spermidine, to the side chain amino group of a specific lysine residue in eIF-5A. Activation of eIF-5A involves transfer of the butylamine residue of spermidine to the lysine of eIF-5A, forming hypusine and activating eIF-5A. In eukaryotes, deoxyhypusine synthase (DHS) mediates the post-translational synthesis of hypusine in eIF-5A. The hypusine modification has been shown to be essential for eIF-5A activity in vitro using a methionyl-puromycin assay.

US-20060294623-A1.5778.1066 DHS converts a conserved lysine residue of eIF-5A to deoxyhypusine through the addition of a butylamine group derived from spermidine. This intermediate form of eIF-5A is then hydroxylated by DHH to become hypusine. Park et al., Biol. Signals 6, 115-123 (1997). Both the deoxyhypusine and the hypusine form of eIF-5A are able to bind mRNA in vitro. Liu et al., Biol Signals 6:166-174 (1997). Although the function of eIF-5A is not fully understood, there is some evidence that it may regulate cell division (Park et al., J Biol Chem 263:15264-15269 (1998); Tome et al., Biol Signals 6:150-156, (1997)) and senescence. (Wang et al., J. Biol. Chem. 276(20): 17541-17549 (2001)). See also U.S. Pat. No. 6,538,182 and U.S. application Ser. No. 09/725,019, which are herein incorporated by reference in their entirety. It appears that several organisms are known to have more than one isoform of eIF-5A, which would suit the premise that each isoform is a specific shuttle to specific suites of mRNAs that are involved in such processes as cell division and senescence. 
US-20060294623-A1.6844.593Arabidopsis thaliana only have one copy of DHS in their genome, as shown by Southern blot (Wang et al., 2001) and BLAST analysis, in order to target the specific eIF-5A isoform responsible for shuttling of senescence transcripts out of the nucleus, the senescence specific isoform of eIF-5A must be identified and specifically down-regulated through the antisense constructs of senescence-induced eIF-5A (of the 3′UTR) or by taking advantage of the plant's natural ability for down-regulation of an over expressed gene (i.e. creating over-expression through the use of sense polynucleotides). 
US-20060294623-A1.7437.713 Plants lack immune systems and thus, have a unique way of dealing with viruses—called co-suppression, which results in sequence-specific degradation of the viral RNA. When a transgene is under a strong constitutive promoter, like the cauliflower mosaic virus double 35S promoter, it appears as a viral transcript to the plant and sequence-specific degradation occurs, but not just of the transgene, but also the endogenous gene. (reviewed in Fagard and Vaucheret, Annual Review. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol., June; 51:167-194 (2000). There is some evidence that co-suppression may be as effective, if not more effective, than antisense suppression of expression for the down-regulation of an endogenous gene.

US-20060294623-A1.22128.1181 As used herein, the term “substantial sequence identity” or “substantial homology” is used to indicate that a nucleotide sequence or an amino acid sequence exhibits substantial structural or functional equivalence with another nucleotide or amino acid sequence. Any structural or functional differences between sequences having substantial sequence identity or substantial homology will be de minimis; that is, they will not affect the ability of the sequence to function as indicated in the desired application. Differences may be due to inherent variations in codon usage among different species, for example. Structural differences are considered de minimis if there is a significant amount of sequence overlap or similarity between two or more different sequences or if the different sequences exhibit similar physical characteristics even if the sequences differ in length or structure. Such characteristics include, for example, ability to hybridize under defined conditions, or in the case of proteins, immunological crossreactivity, similar enzymatic activity, etc. Each of these characteristics can readily be determined by the skilled practitioner by art known methods. 
US-20060294623-A1.23309.362 Additionally, two nucleotide sequences are “substantially complementary” if the sequences have at least about 70 percent, more preferably, 80 percent and most preferably about 90 percent sequence similarity between them. Two amino acid sequences are substantially homologous if they have at least 70% similarity between the active portions of the polypeptides. 
US-20060294623-A1.23671.1209 As used herein, the phrase “hybridizes to a corresponding portion” of a DNA or RNA molecule means that the molecule that hybridizes, e.g., oligonucleotide, polynucleotide, or any nucleotide sequence (in sense or antisense orientation) recognizes and hybridizes to a sequence in another nucleic acid molecule that is of approximately the same size and has enough sequence similarity thereto to effect hybridization under appropriate conditions. For example, a 100 nucleotide long antisense molecule from the 3′ coding or non-coding region of tomato wounding-induced eIF-5A will recognize and hybridize to an approximately 100 nucleotide portion of a nucleotide sequence within the 3′ coding or non-coding region, respectively of AT wounding-induced eIF-5A gene or any other plant wounding-induced eIF-5A gene so long as there is about 70% or more sequence similarity between the two sequences. It is to be understood that the size of the “corresponding portion” will allow for some mismatches in hybridization such that the “corresponding portion” may be smaller or larger than the molecule which hybridizes to it, for example 20-30% larger or smaller, preferably no more than about 12-15% larger or smaller. 
US-20060294623-A1.24880.937 The term “functional derivative” of a nucleic acid (or polynucleotide) as used herein means a fragment, variant, homolog, or analog of the gene or nucleotide sequence encoding senescence-induced eIF-5A, wounding-induced eIF-5A, growth eIF-5A or DHS. A functional derivative retains at least a portion of the function of the senescence-induced eIF-5A, wounding-induced eIF-5A, growth eIF-5A or DHS encoding DNA, which permits its utility in accordance with the invention. Such function may include the ability to hybridize under high stringency conditions with native isolated senescence-induced eIF-5A, wounding-induced eIF-5A, growth eIF-5A or DHS or substantially homologous DNA from another plant or an mRNA transcript thereof, and which senescence-induced eIF-5A, wounding-induced eIF-5A, growth eIF-5A or DHS in antisense orientation inhibits expression of senescence-induced eIF-5A, wounding-induced eIF-5A, growth eIF-5A or DHS. 
US-20060294623-A1.25817.713 A “fragment” of the gene or DNA sequence refers to any subset of the molecule, e.g., a shorter polynucleotide or oligonucleotide. A “variant” refers to a molecule substantially similar to either the entire gene or a fragment thereof, such as a nucleotide substitution variant having one or more substituted nucleotides, but which maintains the ability to hybridize with the particular gene or to encode mRNA transcript which hybridizes with the native DNA. A “homolog” refers to a fragment or variant sequence from a different plant genus or species. An “analog” refers to a non-natural molecule substantially similar to or functioning in relation to either the entire molecule, a variant or a fragment thereof. 
US-20060294623-A1.26530.530 By “modulating expression” it is meant that either the expression is inhibited or up-regulated. “Inhibition of expression” refers to the absence or detectable decrease in the level of protein and/or mRNA product from a target gene, such as senescence-induced eIF-5A, wounding-induced eIF-5A, growth eIF-5A or DHS. “Up-regulation” or “over expression” refers to a detectable increase in the level of protein and/or mRNA product from a target gene, such as senescence-induced eIF-5A, wounding-induced eIF-5A, growth eIF-5A or DHS.

A fragment of eIF-5A or DHS peptide refers to any subset of the molecule. Variant peptides may be made by direct chemical synthesis, for example, using methods well known in the art. An analog of eIF-5A or DHS peptide refers to a non-natural protein substantially similar to either the entire protein or a fragment thereof. Chemical derivatives of eIF-5A or DHS contain additional chemical moieties not normally a part of the peptide or peptide fragment. Modifications may be introduced into peptides or fragments thereof by reacting targeted amino acid residues of the peptide with an organic derivatizing agent that is capable of reacting with selected side chains or terminal residues.

US-20060294623-A1.31177.997 The present invention relates to three different isoforms of eIF-5A: senescence-induced eIF-5A; wounding induced eIF-5A; and growth eIF-5A. The present invention provides various isoforms of eIF-5A isolated from various plant species and methods of isolating the various isoforms eIF-5A. The present invention also provides polynucleotides that encode these various isoforms of eIF-5A of the present invention. The invention also provides antisense polynucleotides of the isoforms of eIF-5A and expression vectors containing such polynucleotides or antisense polynucleotides. In some embodiments, there are provided methods of inhibiting expression of endogenous eIF-5As through the use of expression vectors containing antisense polynucleotides of the isoforms of eIF-5A to transform plants. In some embodiments, there are provided methods of up-regulating endogenous eIF-5A isoforms by providing expression vectors containing polynucleotides of the isoforms of eIF-5A in the sense orientation. 
US-20060294623-A1.32174.858 The different isoforms are naturally up or down-regulated depending upon the life stage of the plant or the plant's condition. For example in senescing tissues, the senescence-induced eIF-5A isoforn is up-regulated. The senescence-induced eIF-5A is thought to participate in further senescence of the plant or plant tissues by shuttling specific subsets of mRNAs (those involved in the senescence pathway) from the nucleus to the cytoplasm for translation. By down regulating or inhibiting the expression of senescence-induced eIF-5A, senescence can be delayed in the plant and/or plant tissues. Delayed senescence is manifested in the transformed/transgenic plants by having a larger bio-mass, increased shelf life for fruit, increased shelf life of flowers, increased seed size and increased seed yield as compared to non-transformed or wild type plants. 
US-20060294623-A1.33032.421 When a plant and/or plant tissues are exposed to a wounding event, such as chilling, dehydration, or mechanical forces, wounding-induced eIF-5A isoform is up-regulated. By down regulating the expression of wounding-induced eIF-5A, an increased resistance to virulent damage arising from pathogen ingression is conferred on the plants as compared to resistance to virulent damage in non-transformned or wild type plants. 
US-20060294623-A1.33453.214 When a plant is in the growth phase, growth eIF-5A isoform is up-regulated. By up-regulating growth eIF-5A, the resulting transgenic plants have an increased seed size, increased biomass and increased seed yield.

US-20060294623-A1.33723.647FIG. 8 reveals that the amount of the senescence-induced factor eIF-5A isoform increases as the ages of the leaves increases. It is not seen in the unopened flower buds, siliques or stems but it is seen in the imbibed seeds. In the imbibed seeds there is cotyledon tissue as well as growing embryo. Thus, senescence-induced eIF-5A is present in the imbibed seeds because the cotyledon tissue is senescing as the embryo is growing. Growth eIF-5A is seen in the imbibed seeds because there the embryo is actively growing. The wounding-induced eIF-5A is seen in the siliques, seeds and stems as the harvesting of these tissues induces some wounding.

Senescence-induced eIF-5A is up-regulated in senescing tissues and is involved in the induction of senescence related morphological changes in plants and plant tissues. Inhibiting expression of senescence-induced eIF-5A in plants can be used to alter senescence and senescence-related processes in plants. Down-regulation may occur through either the use of antisense constructs or through use of sense constructs to achieve co-suppression. Inhibiting expression of senescence-induced eIF-5A results in various morphological changes in the transgenic plants, including increased plant bio-mass, delayed fruit softening or spoilage, delayed browning of cut flowers or plant tissues, such as lettuce leaves, increased seed yield and increased seed size.

Functional variants are those variants, either natural or man made, that have at least 80% sequence homology to and hybridizes under high stringency conditions with the corresponding portion of the senescence-induced eIF-5A. Further the variant must have the function as intended by the present invention, that is it is capable of modulating expression of endogenous senescence-induced eIF-5A when introduced into an expression vector and wherein such vector is incorporated into the genome of at least one plant cell. One skilled in the art can appreciate that insubstantial changes can be made in the sequence that would not effect detrimentally the ability of the antisense polynucleotide to bind to the transcript and reduce or inhibition expression of the gene.

Because the growth eIF-5A is a cell-division isoform and because it is constitutively expressed, there is increased cell division. A reduction in senescence occurs because the plant is locked into a growth mode and can not make the switch to the senescence pathway.

US-20060294623-A1.50472.336FIGS. 27 and 28 are from lines that have no up-regulation (which may be due to co-suppression of the gene). Since the plant is kanomycin resistant, the gene must be present in order for the plants to grow on the media. It appears that the senescence-induced eIF-5A is also co-suppressed as well thus giving rise to an increase in size. 
US-20060294623-A1.50808.385 In addition to increased biomass, there is also increased seed size in plants having growth eIF-5A up-regulated. The seed size of all of the lines was measured. In the lines having the highest levels of growth eIF-5A expression, a greater than 3× increase in seed size is seen. This occurs because up-regulation of growth eIF-5A, increases cell division and thus increases seed size. 
US-20060294623-A1.51193.592Arabidopsis thaliana) in the above examples was being constitutively expressed, i.e. is being expressed everywhere in the plant through the use of a universal promoter. In contrast, by using a tissue specific promoter, one may direct the up-regulation in particular tissues. For example, by using a seed specific promoter, the growth eIF-5A would only be up-regulated in the seed, allowing the leaves to grow normally, but produce an increase in the amount of seeds. Thus, using a specific promoter, the growth eIF-5A can be up-regulated in the desired plant part to get a desired phenotype. 
US-20060294623-A1.51785.1017 By up-regulating growth eIF-5A, three phenotypes result - increased biomass, increased seed yield, or increased seed size, but not all three phenotypes are present at the same time (or in the same plant). For example, if a plant exhibits an increase in seed size, a smaller plant will be present. In the plant lines that had the highest up-regulation of growth eIF-5A, the biggest seeds were produced, but the plants were smaller because there was massive cell division going on throughout the whole plant, which was at the expense of cell enlargement (needed for bigger leaves). At lower levels of up-regulation of expression of growth AteIF-5A, one sees an impact on the leaves (bigger) without impacting the seed. Thus, one may use tissue specific expression and pick the phenotype desired. For example, one may place growth eIF-5A under a xylem specific promoter to achieve an increase in the amount of xylem produced. Thus, any desired promoter may be used to achieve the desired tissue-specific up-regulation.

US-20060294623-A1.53564.551 The present invention also provides antisense polynucleotides of DHS. The antisense polynucleotides may be of any length as long as they are able to inhibit expression. In some embodiments the antisense polynucleotides comprise the full length coding sequence, directed at the 3′UTR, or directed at the 5′-non-coding sequence Antisense polynucleotides primarily complementary to 5′-non-coding sequences are known to be effective inhibitors of expression of genes encoding transcription factors.

US-20060294623-A1.55335.357 The present invention also provides methods of inhibiting expression of endogenous DHS. These methods comprise integrating into the genome of at least one cell of a plant, expression vectors of the present invention comprising antisense polynucleotides of DHS. The antisense polynucleotides of DHS are transcribed and inhibit expression of endogenous DHS. 
US-20060294623-A1.55692.389 In another method of inhibiting expression of endogenous DHS, an expression vector containing a DHS polynucleotide of the present invention in a sense orientation is integrated into the genome of at least one cell of a plant. The polynucleotide of DHS is transcribed and the resulting co-expression of exogenous DHS causes a down-regulation or inhibition of expression of endogenous DHS. 
US-20060294623-A1.56081.730 By inhibiting expression of endogenous DHS, resulting transgenic plants have no or substantially less DHS protein to activate eIF-5A. As discussed earlier, eIF-5A must be activated to render it biologically useful. Thus, by inhibiting or reducing the expression of DHS either by antisense polynucleotides or by co-suppression with sense polynucleotides, the resulting transgenic plants will either have no active eIF-5A or reduced active eIF-5A. These transgenic plants will exhibit an increase in biomass of the plant, increased seed yield and/or increased seed size. Transgenic plants having antisense polynucleotides of DHS show an increase in photosynthesis and also have an increased starch content. See Examples 24 and 25. 
US-20060294623-A1.56811.1071 Further evidence to support the contention that DHS and eIF-5A play regulatory roles in senescence was provided by treating carnation flowers with inhibitors that are specific for DHS. Spermidine and eIF-5A are the substrates of DHS reaction (Park et al., 1993; Park et al., 1997). Several mono-, di-, and polyamines that have structural features similar to spermidine inhibit DHS activity in vitro (Jakus et al., 1993). Some polyamines, such as spermidine, putrescine, and spermine, have been generally used to extend carnation vase life (Wang and Baker, 1980). Through treatment with different polyamines at different concentrations Wang et al (unpublished b) were able to extend the vase life of carnation flowers by 2 fold. Further studies employing a transient infection system to down-regulate DHS is in progress. Preliminary data indicates that the percent survival rate is almost 4 fold higher at day 8 in cut carnations that were vacuum infiltrated with a transient infection system expressing antisense DHS than untreated flowers (Wang et al., unpublished b). 
US-20060294623-A1.57882.1129 A further major loss in agriculture besides the loss of growth due to stress is post harvest stress-induced senescence (McCabe et al., 2001). This is especially true for plants that are partially processed such as cut lettuce. A symptom of cutting lettuce is browning which is a result of phenolics production (Matile et al., 1999). A field trial of lettuce with anti sense polynucleotides of lettuce eIF-5A (LeIF-5A) or antisense full length DHS demonstrated that the transgenic lettuce was significantly more resistant to browning after cutting than the control lettuce. It appears that even though stress induced senescence due to harvesting has distinct circuitry (Page et al., 2001), the translational control upstream of browning and likely other senescence symptoms is regulated at least in part by DHS and eIF-5A. Downstream of the regulation of senescence are the execution genes. These are the effectors of senescence and cause the metabolic changes that bring on the senescence syndrome. It appears that eIF-5A and DHS when down-regulated are capable of dampening down a whole range of symptoms caused by senescence. 
US-20060294623-A1.59011.182 The present invention also relates to antibodies that recognize the three isoforms of eIF-5A(senescence-induced factor eIF-5A); (wounding factor eiF-5A) and (growth factor eIF-5A).

The downstream primer is 5′ GAG CTC AAG AAT AAC ATC TCA TAA GAAAC3′ (SEQ ID NO:______) The upstream primer is 5′ CTC GAG TGC TCA CTT CTC TCT CTT AGG 3′ (SEQ ID NO:______). 
US-20060294623-A1.59513.405 Before isolating wounding-induced eIF5A from a plant or plant part, it is best to introduce a wounding event to allow the plant to begin expressing wounding-induced eIF-5A. Any wounding event is acceptable and one such exemplary wound events included crushing the leaves at the central vein. Similarly, before isolating senescence-induced eIF-5A, it best to stress the plant tissue to induce senescence.

No senescence AteIF-5A was detected in the PEG treated plants or control, but was present in the flower lane (which included senescent flowers) and in the imbibed seed lane reflecting senescence of cotyledonary tissues. When the blot was probed with the wounding-induced αATeIF-5A antibody, faint bands appeared in the siliques, imbibed seed and stem lanes. The band seen in the siliques and stem lanes may be due to the wounding that occurred with collection of the tissue. Since it is difficult to collect the siliques and stem, they were not flash frozen immediately allowing for some up-regulation of the wounding-induced isoform of AteIF-5A. The only band that appeared when the blot was probed with growth αAT-eIF5A was imbibed seeds, keeping with the notion that this is the isoform involved in cell division.

Some other phenotypes observed in the T1 generation of Sense wounding-induced AteIF-5A plants included yellow leaves, purple cotyledons, curled up leaves and differences in flower shape. It is interesting to note that the appearance in the stunted growth was not observed until the plants were transplanted to soil. A possible explanation of this would be that during transplant the roots are damaged slightly (a consequence of transplanting that is unavoidable) and were unable to recover. In fact a preliminary experiment where seeds were soaked in a Kanamycin solution and seeded to soil directly no stunted plants were observed (whereas previously 70% of the plants had some degree of stunting), as no root damage would be invoked without transplantation.

Since most of the sublines A-H demonstrated similar phenotypes within a line, the Western blot was only done with subline A of each line to get a general overview of level of expression of growth AteIF-5A. Protein from the cauline leaves of wild type plants and plants containing the empty binary vector were used as controls on the gels. The level of expression observed in these sublines can be categorized as high (Lines 1, 2, 3, 10, 13), medium (Lines 4, 5, 6, 15), low (Lines 7,8,9,14) or none (Lines 11, 16, wild type and binary control). The blots were also probed with antibodies against senescence-induced AteIF-5A and wounding-induced AteIF-5A. These westerns indicated that the increase in expression in the Sense growth AteIF-5A lines is due to growth AteIF-5A and not a general upregulation of other AteIF-5A isoforms, as no significant amount of either isoform was detected. This also demonstrated that the specificity of the isoform specific antibodies is acceptable.

Plants from line 11 (one of the cosuppression lines) were not as healthy as typically found at this age. These seeds were also one of the smallest measured. It appears that these lines are still segregating, as there were still non-Kanamycin resistant plants as well as seeds that did not germinate from all the lines. This is probably a side effect of the transgene and not technique as the control seeds that were treated in the same manner, all germinated.

SAG 12 is a gene with the closest specificity for natural senescence and is thus termed a senescence marker. With no detectable expression in young leaves, SAG 12 is induced in older leaves after they are ˜20% yellow but cannot be induced by treatment that does not induce yellowing of leaves (Weaver et al., 1998). Its high degree of specificity for natural senescence can be explained by the fact that the gene product of SAG 12 shows similarity to cysteine proteases and may be involved in protein turnover during senescence (Lohman et al., 1994; Weaver et al., 1998).

This technique measures not only the nitrogen present in true proteins, but also that present in non-protein forms such as ammonia, urea and nitrate. Because most of the non-protein forms of nitrogen are converted to true protein by the rumen microorganisms, CP is considered by nutritionists to provide an accurate measure of the protein that will be available to ruminant animals from a given forage.

US-20060294624-A1.4185.424 Acid-Detergent Fiber (“ADF”) approximates the amount of fiber present in a feed that is indigestible. Forages with high ADF values are less digestible than forages with low ADF values and, therefore, provide fewer nutrients to the animal through digestion. Because of this relationship, ADF serves as an estimate of digestibility and can be used by nutritionists to predict the energy that will be available from a forage. 
US-20060294624-A1.4609.684 Neutral-Detergent Fiber (“NDF”) represents the total amount of fiber present in the alfalfa. Because fiber is the portion of the plant most slowly digested in the rumen, it is this fraction that fills the rumen and becomes a limit to the amount of feed an animal can consume. The higher the NDF concentration of a forage, the quicker the rumen will fill and the less an animal will be able to consume. For this reason, NDF is used by nutritionists as an estimate of the quantity of forage that an animal will be able to consume. Forages with high NDF levels can limit intake to the point that an animal is unable to consume enough feed to meet their energy and protein requirements. 
US-20060294624-A1.5293.711 Relative Feed Value (“RFV”) is a numeric value assigned to forages based upon their ADF and NDF values. In this calculation, NDF is used to estimate the dry matter intake expected for a given forage and the ADF concentration is used to estimate the digestibility of the forage. By combining these two relationships, an estimate of digestible dry matter intake is generated. This value is then reported relative to a standard forage (fall bloom alfalfa=100) and can be used to rank forages based on their anticipated feeding value. Relative feed value has been accepted in many areas as a means of estimating forage feeding value and is commonly used in determining the price of alfalfa at tested hay auctions. 
US-20060294624-A1.6004.650 In Vitro True Digestibility (IVTD) is a measurement of digestibility utilizing actual rumen microorganisms. Although ADF serves as a good estimate of digestibility, IVID provides a more accurate assessment of a forage's feeding value by actually measuring tie portion of a forage that is digested. This process is more expensive and time consuming than the analysis for ADF concentrations of a feed, but provides a more meaningful measure of forage digestibility. Techniques for measuring in vitro digestibility are based on incubating a forage sample in a solution containing rumen microorganisms for an extended period of time (usually 48 hours). 
US-20060294624-A1.6654.524 Total Digestible Nutrients (TDN) is an estimate of the energy content of a feedstuff based on its relative proportions of fiber, fat, carbohydrate, crude protein, and ash. Because it is expensive to measure each of these components, TDN is usually estimated from ADF or IVTD. Although still used in some areas as a criteria for evaluating alfalfa hay at auctions, TDN has been shown to overestimate the energy content of low quality forages and thus does not accurately reflect the nutritional value of all forage samples. 
US-20060294624-A1.7178.857 Milk Per Ton is an estimate of the milk production that could be supported by a given forage when fed as part of a total mixed ration. The equation for calculating milk per ton uses NDF and ADF to calculate total energy intake possible from the forage. After subtracting the amount of energy required for daily maintenance of the cow, the quantity of milk that could be produced from the remaining energy is calculated. The ratio of milk produced to forage consumed is then reported in the units of pounds of milk produced per ton of forage consumed. Milk per ton is useful because it characterizes forage quality in two terms that a dairy farmer is familiar with: pounds of milk and tons of forage. By combining milk per ton and dry matter yield per acre, we arrive at “milk per acre”. This term is widely used to estimate the economic value of a forage. 
US-20060294624-A1.8035.358 Potato Leafhopper Resistance—a reaction of the alfalfa host plant which enables it to avoid serious damage from potato leafhopper feeding. The resistant plant reaction is to demonstrate normal growth in the presence of high populations of potato leafhoppers, whereas susceptible plants show significant stunting and yellowing in reaction to insect feeding. 
US-20060294624-A1.8393.1436 Percentage of alfalfa plant having resistance to potato leafhopper—Alfalfa varieties are heterogeneous populations formed by intercrossing a number of alfalfa clones. Pest resistance in alfalfa varieties is commonly measured in standard tests as the percent of plants in the population that express the resistance trait. The National Alfalfa Variety Review Board in accordance with the recommendation of the North American Alfalfa Improvement Conference has adopted a convention that uses percent resistant plants to describe levels of pest resistance. This convention is as follows: (0-5%)=susceptible, (6-15%)=low resistance, (16-30%)=moderate resistance, (31-50%)=resistance, and (>51%)=high resistance. With most pests, economic losses due to pest damage are minimized or eliminated with varieties containing resistance to high resistance. Individual plants can also have varying levels of resistance. The convention used for measuring PLH damage in this application was patterned after standard tests used for measuring damage/resistance to other pests. Individual plants are scored on a (1-5) scale, where 1=no damage evident and 5=severe stunting and yellowing. Plants scored as 1 and 2 are classified as resistant. The average severity index (ASI) of a variety is the average damage score for 100 random plants. The ASI is often used in combination with percent resistance to characterize pest resistance of alfalfa cultivars. 
US-20060294624-A1.9829.415 Using this standard convention, an alfalfa variety described as being resistant to PLH has between (31%-50%) of the plants in the variety being scored 1 or 2 in a standard test to measure PLH reaction. Individual alfalfa plants or clones (clonal propagules of individual genotypes) with a resistance score of 1 have very high resistance; a score of 3 show moderate resistance; and a score of 5 show no resistance. 
US-20060294624-A1.10244.785 Fall Dormancy (FD)—Most alfalfa plants go dormant in the fall in preparation for winter. The onset of dormancy is triggered by a combination of day length and temperature and is genotype dependent. Fall dormancy scores measure the dormancy response of alfalfa genotypes by quantifying how early dormancy is triggered. The standard fall dormancy test requires that plants are cut off in early September with plant height measured in mid October. Early fall dormant types show very little growth after the September clipping, later fall dormant type demonstrate substantial growth. Fall dormancy is measured on a (1-9) scale, where 1=very early fall dormant and 9=non-dormant. The fall dormancy classes (2-4) are winterhardy types typically planted in the Midwest and Northeastern U.S. 
US-20060294624-A1.11029.620 Winterhardiness (WH)—Winterhardiness is a measure of the ability of an alfalfa plant to survive the stresses associated with winter. Cold hardiness is a key feature of the winterhardiness trait. There is a general relationship between fall dormancy and winterhardiness, the early fall dormant types (FD2-4) being more winterhardy than the later fall dormant types (FD5-9). The winterhardiness rating used in this patent are derived from the standard test for measuring winter survival. The standard test measures plant survival and spring vigor following a winter stress enough to substantially injure check varieties. 
US-20060294624-A1.11649.498 Regrowth (Rgw) Rate—Alfalfa is cut 3-4 times per year in the Midwest and Northeastern U.S. The rate of regrowth after cutting varies widely by genotype. It is generally accepted that the rate of regrowth after cutting is one of several factors that influences forage yield potential in alfalfa. Regrowth rate is measured by a visual estimation of canopy height about 10 days after cutting. The scoring system used in this patent was a (1-10 scale) with 1=slowest regrowth and 10=fastest regrowth. 
US-20060294624-A1.12147.1268 Dormancy—Alfalfa is classified into fall dormancy groups, numbered 1 to 10, where Dormancy Group 1 is very dormant and suited for cold climates (such varieties would stop growing and go dormant over winter), and Dormancy Group 10 is very non-dormant and suited for very hot climates (such varieties would have high growth rates over a very long growing season and would have relatively high winter activity). Until recently, the NAVRB (National Alfalfa Variety Review Board), which recently changed its name to “National Alfalfa and Miscellaneous Legume Variety Review Board” (NA&MLVRB), recognized standard or check varieties for Dormancy Groups 1-9, but did not have a standard check variety for Group 10. Check cultivars are listed in the NAAIC Standard Tests to Characterize Alfalfa Cultivars, 3rd Edition, as amended, July 1998.

US-20060294624-A1.14409.589 Alfalfa is an auto-tetraploid and is frequently self-incompatible in breeding. When selfed, little or no seed is produced, or the seed may not germinate, or when it does, it may later stop growing. Typically, fewer than five percent of selfed crosses produce seed. When a very small population is crossbred, inbreeding depression occurs, and traits of interest, such as quality, yield, and resistance to a large number of pests (e.g., seven or eight different pests), are lost. Thus, producing a true breeding parent for hybrids is not possible, which complicates breeding substantially. 
US-20060294624-A1.14998.379 Efforts to develop alfalfa varieties having improved traits and increased production have focused on breeding for disease, insect, or nematode resistance, persistence, adaptation to specific environments, increased yield, and improved quality. Breeders have had some success in breeding for increased herbage quality and forage yield, although there are significant challenges. 
US-20060294624-A1.15377.401 Breeding programs typically emphasize maximizing heterogeneity of a given alfalfa variety to improve yield and stability. However, this generally results in wide variations in characteristics such as flowering dates, flowering frequency, development rate, growth rate, fall dormancy and winter hardiness. Prior art breeding methods do not emphasize improving the uniformity of these characteristics.

US-20060294624-A1.19552.344 In the controlled pollination step, the cytoplasmic male sterile plants are typically grown in separate rows from the maintainer plants. The plants are pollinated by pollen-carrying insects, such as bees. Segregating the male sterile and maintainer plants facilitates selective harvest of hybrid seed from the cytoplasmic male sterile plants.

No. 5,324,646 issued Jun. 28, 1994, which is hereby incorporated by reference. Additionally, researchers believe that somatic embryogenesis in alfalfa is heritable, and is controlled by relatively few genes. Efforts at improving regeneration have thus been directed towards isolation of the genetic control of embryogenesis, and breeding programs which would incorporate such information. See, e.g., M. M. Hernandez-Fernandez, and B. R. Christie, Genome 32:318-321 (1989); I. M. Ray and E. T. Bingham, Crop Science 29:1545-1548 (1989).

US-20060294624-A1.22659.1146 The advent of new molecular biological techniques has allowed the isolation and characterization of genetic elements with specific functions, such as encoding specific protein products. Scientists in the field of plant biology developed a strong interest in engineering the genome of plants to contain and express foreign genetic elements, or additional, or modified versions of native or endogenous genetic elements in order to alter the traits of a plant in a specific manner. Any DNA sequences, whether from a different species or from the same species, which are inserted into the genome using transformation are referred to herein collectively as “transgenes”. In some embodiments of the invention, a transformed variant of 53V52 may contain at least one transgene but could contain at least 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 and/or no more than 15, 14, 13, 12, 11, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, or 2. Over the last fifteen to twenty years several methods for producing transgenic plants have been developed, and the present invention also relates to transformed versions of the claimed alfalfa variety 53V52 as well as hybrid combinations thereof.

US-20060294624-A1.23951.330 The most prevalent types of plant transformation involve the construction of an expression vector. Such a vector comprises a DNA sequence that contains a gene under the control of or operatively linked to a regulatory element, for example a promoter. The vector may contain one or more genes and one or more regulatory elements. 
US-20060294624-A1.24281.439 A genetic trait which has been engineered into the genome of a particular alfalfa plant using transformation techniques, could be moved into the genome of another line using traditional breeding techniques that are well known in the plant breeding arts. For example, a backcrossing approach may be used to move a transgene from a transformed alfalfa plant to an elite line, and the resulting progeny would then comprise the transgene(s). 
US-20060294624-A1.24720.370 Various genetic elements can be introduced into the plant genome using transformation. These elements include, but are not limited to genes; coding sequences; inducible, constitutive, and tissue specific promoters; enhancing sequences; and signal and targeting sequences. For example, see the traits, genes and transformation methods listed in U.S. Pat. No. 6,118,055.

Map information concerning chromosomal location is useful for proprietary protection of a subject transgenic plant. If unauthorized propagation is undertaken and crosses made with other germplasm, the map of the integration region can be compared to similar maps for suspect plants to determine if the latter have a common parentage with the subject plant. Map comparisons would involve hybridizations, RFLP, PCR, SSR and sequencing, all of which are conventional techniques. SNPs may also be used alone or in combination with other techniques. 
US-20060294624-A1.26067.933 Likewise, by means of the present invention, plants can be genetically engineered to express various phenotypes of agronomic interest. Through the transformation of alfalfa the expression of genes can be altered to enhance disease resistance, insect resistance, herbicide resistance, agronomic, grain quality and other traits. Transformation can also be used to insert DNA sequences which control or help control male-sterility. DNA sequences native to alfalfa as well as non-native DNA sequences can be transformed into alfalfa and used to alter levels of native or non-native proteins. Various promoters, targeting sequences, enhancing sequences, and other DNA sequences can be inserted into the alfalfa genome for the purpose of altering the expression of proteins. Reduction of the activity of specific genes (also known as gene silencing, or gene suppression) is desirable for several aspects of genetic engineering in plants.

US-20060294624-A1.37084.1066 There are several methods of conferring genetic male sterility available, such as multiple mutant genes at separate locations within the genome that confer male sterility, as disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,654,465 and 4,727,219 to Brar et al. and chromosomal translocations as described by Patterson in U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,861,709 and 3,710,511. In addition to these methods, Albertsen et al., U.S. Pat. No. 5,432,068, describe a system of nuclear male sterility which includes: identifying a gene which is critical to male fertility; silencing this native gene which is critical to male fertility; removing the native promoter from the essential male fertility gene and replacing it with an inducible promoter; inserting this genetically engineered gene back into the plant; and thus creating a plant that is male sterile because the inducible promoter is not “on” resulting in the male fertility gene not being transcribed. Fertility is restored by inducing, or turning “on”, the promoter, which in turn allows the gene that confers male fertility to be transcribed.

US-20060294625-A1.281.658Sclerotinia produces sclerotia, irregularly-shaped, dark overwintering bodies, which can endure in soil for four to five years. The sclerotia can germinate carpogenically or myceliogenically, depending on the environmental conditions and crop canopies. The two types of germination cause two distinct types of diseases. Sclerotia that germinate carpogenically produce apothecia and ascospores that infect above-ground tissues, resulting in stem blight, stalk rot, head rot, pod rot, white mold, and blossom blight of plants. Sclerotia that germinate myceliogenically produce mycelia that infect root tissues, causing crown rot, root rot and basal stalk rot. 
US-20060294625-A1.939.745Brassica having a low level of glucosinolates and erucic acid in the seed. The sclerotia germinate carpogenically in the summer, producing apothecia. The apothecia release wind-borne ascospores that travel up to one kilometer. The disease is favoured by moist soil conditions (at least 10 days at or near field capacity) and temperatures of 15-25° C., prior to and during canola flowering. The spores cannot infect leaves and stems directly; they must first land on flowers, fallen petals, and pollen on the stems and leaves. Petal age affects the efficiency of infection, with older petals more likely to result in infection (Heran, et al., 1999). The fungal spores use the flower parts as a food source as they germinate and infect the plant. 
US-20060294625-A1.1684.198Sclerotinia sclerotiorum caused economic losses to canola growers in Minnesota and North Dakota of 17.3, 20.8, and 16.8 million dollars in 1999, 2000, and 2001, respectively. (Bradley, et al. 2006) 
US-20060294625-A1.1882.937Sclerotinia infection usually develop several weeks after flowering begins. The plants develop pale-grey to white lesions, at or above the soil line and on upper branches and pods. The infections often develop where the leaf and the stem join because the infected petals lodge there. Once plants are infected, the mold continues to grow into the stem and invade healthy tissue. Infected stems appear bleached and tend to shred. Hard black fungal sclerotia develop within the infected stems, branches, or pods. Plants infected at flowering produce little or no seed. Plants with girdled stems wilt and ripen prematurely. Severely infected crops frequently lodge, shatter at swathing, and make swathing more time consuming. Infections can occur in all above-ground plant parts, especially in dense or lodged stands, where plant-to-plant contact facilitates the spread of infection. New sclerotia carry the disease over to the next season. 
US-20060294625-A1.2819.134Sclerotinia diseases include (a) chemical control, (b) disease resistance and (c) cultural control, each of which is described below.

The fungicide should be applied before symptoms of stem rot are visible and usually at the 20-30% bloom stage of the crop. If infection is already evident, there is no use in applying fungicide as it is too late to have an effect. Accordingly, growers must assess their fields for disease risk to decide whether to apply a fungicide. This can be done by using a government provided checklist or by using a petal testing kit. Either method is cumbersome and prone to errors. (Hind-Lanoiselet 2004; Johnson 2005)

US-20060294625-A1.14220.731 A cross between two different homozygous lines produces a uniform population of hybrid plants (also called F1 hybrid plants) that may be heterozygous for many gene loci. A cross of two heterozygous plants that differ at a number of gene loci will produce a population of plants that differ genetically and will not be uniform. Regardless of parentage, plants that have been self-pollinated and selected for type for many generations become homozygous at almost all gene loci and produce a uniform population of true pureline progeny. The term “inbred” as used herein refers to a homozygous plant or a collection of homozygous plants. Those of ordinary skill will understand that some residual heterozygosity may exist in inbreds. 
US-20060294625-A1.14951.628 Choice of breeding or selection methods depends on the mode of plant reproduction, the heritability of the trait(s) being improved, and the type of variety used commercially (e.g., F1 hybrid variety, pureline variety, etc.). For highly heritable traits, a choice of superior individual plants evaluated at a single location will be effective, whereas for traits with low heritability, selection should be based on mean values obtained from replicated evaluations of families of related plants. Popular selection methods commonly include pedigree selection, modified pedigree selection, mass selection, and recurrent selection. 
US-20060294625-A1.15579.659 The complexity of inheritance influences choice of the breeding method. In general, breeding starts with the crossing of two genotypes, each of which may have one or more desirable characteristics that is lacking in the other or which complements the other. If the two original parents do not provide all the desired characteristics, other sources can be included by making more crosses. In each successive filial generation, F1 to F2; F2 to F3; F3 to F4; F4 to F5, etc., plants are selfed to increase the homozygosity of the line. Typically in a breeding program five or more generations of selection and selfing are practiced to obtain a homozygous plant. 
US-20060294625-A1.16238.713 Pedigree breeding is commonly used for the improvement of self-pollinating crops. Two parents that possess favorable, complementary traits are crossed to produce an F1. An F2 population is produced by selfing one or several F1's or by sib-pollinating two F1's. Selection of the best individuals may begin in the F2 population; then, beginning in the F3, the best individuals in the best families are selected. Replicated testing of families can begin in the F4 generation to improve the effectiveness of selection for traits with low heritability. At an advanced stage of inbreeding (i.e., F6 and F7), the best lines or mixtures of phenotypically similar lines are tested for potential release as new varieties. 
US-20060294625-A1.16951.686 Backcross breeding has been used to transfer genes for simply inherited, highly heritable traits from a donor parent into a desirable, optimally homozygous, variety that is utilized as the recurrent parent. The source of the traits to be transferred is called the donor parent. After the initial cross, individuals possessing the desired trait or traits of the donor parent are selected and then repeatedly crossed (backcrossed) to the recurrent parent. The resulting plant is expected to have the attributes of the recurrent parent plus the desirable trait or traits transferred from the donor parent. This approach has been used extensively for breeding disease-resistant varieties. 
US-20060294625-A1.17637.436 Each canola breeding program should include a periodic, objective evaluation of the efficiency of the breeding procedure. Evaluation criteria vary depending on the goal and objectives, but should include gain from selection per year based on comparisons to an appropriate standard, overall value of the advanced breeding lines, and number of successful varieties produced per unit of input (e.g., per year, per dollar expended, etc.). 
US-20060294625-A1.18073.277 Various recurrent selection techniques are used to improve quantitatively inherited traits controlled by numerous genes. The use of recurrent selection in self-pollinating crops depends on the ease of pollination and the number of hybrid offspring from each successful cross. 
US-20060294625-A1.18350.488 Mass selection and recurrent selection can be used to improve populations of either self- or cross-pollinated crops. A genetically variable population of heterozygous individuals is either identified or created by intercrossing several different parents. The best plants are selected based on individual superiority, outstanding progeny, or excellent combining ability. The selected plants are intercrossed to produce a new population in which further cycles of selection are continued. 
US-20060294625-A1.18838.699 The single-seed descent procedure in the strict sense refers to planting a segregating population, harvesting a sample of one seed per plant, and using the one-seed sample to plant the next generation. When the population has been advanced from the F2 to the desired level of inbreeding, the plants from which lines are derived will each trace to different F2 individuals. The number of plants in a population declines each generation due to the failure of some seeds to germinate or due to the failure of some plants to produce at least one seed. As a result, not all of the F2 plants originally sampled in the population will be represented by a progeny when generation advancement is completed. 
US-20060294625-A1.19537.344 In a multiple-seed procedure, canola breeders commonly harvest one or more pods, or siliques, from each plant in a population and thresh them together to form a bulk. Part of the bulk is used to plant the next generation and part is put in reserve. The procedure has been referred to as modified single-seed descent or the pod-bulk technique. 
US-20060294625-A1.19881.569 The multiple-seed procedure has been used to save labor at harvest. It is considerably faster to thresh pods with a machine than to remove one seed from each by hand for the single-seed procedure. The multiple-seed procedure also makes it possible to plant the same number of seeds of a population each generation of inbreeding. Enough seeds are harvested to make up for those plants that did not germinate or produce seed. If desired, the doubled haploid method can be used to extract homogeneous lines, thereby increasing the supply of seed with a desired genotype. 
US-20060294625-A1.20450.904 Molecular markers including techniques such as Isozyme Electrophoresis, Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphisms (RFLPs), Randomly Amplified Polymorphic DNAs (RAPDs), Arbitrarily Primed Polymerase Chain Reaction (AP-PCR), DNA Amplification Fingerprinting (DAF), Sequence Characterized Amplified Regions (SCARs), Amplified Fragment Length Polymorphisms (AFLPs), Simple Sequence Repeats (SSRs) and Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPS) may be used in plant breeding methods. One use of molecular markers is Quantitative Trait Loci (QTL) mapping. QTL mapping is the use of markers which are known to be closely linked to alleles that have measurable effects on a quantitative trait. Selection in the breeding process is based upon the accumulation of markers linked to the positive effecting alleles and/or the elimination of the markers linked to the negative effecting alleles from the plant's genome. 
US-20060294625-A1.21354.822 Molecular markers can also be used during the breeding process for the selection of qualitative traits. For example, markers closely linked to alleles, or markers containing sequences within the actual alleles of interest, can be used to select plants that contain the alleles of interest during a backcrossing breeding program. The markers can also be used to select for the genome of the recurrent parent and against the markers of the donor parent. Using this procedure can minimize the amount of genome from the donor parent that remains in the selected plants. It can also be used to reduce the number of crosses back to the recurrent parent needed in a backcrossing program. The use of molecular markers in the selection process is often called Genetic Marker Enhanced Selection or Marker Assisted Selection (MAS).

US-20060294625-A1.22799.797Brassica plants as the female parent. In using these plants, breeders are attempting to improve the efficiency of seed production and the quality of the F1 hybrids and to reduce the breeding costs. When hybridization is conducted without using SI, CMS or NMS plants, it is more difficult to obtain and isolate the desired traits in the progeny (F1 generation) because the parents are capable of undergoing both cross-pollination and self-pollination. If one of the parents is a SI, CMS or NMS plant that is incapable of producing pollen, only cross pollination will occur. By eliminating the pollen of one parental variety in a cross, a plant breeder is assured of obtaining hybrid seed of uniform quality, provided that the parents are of uniform quality and the breeder conducts a single cross. 
US-20060294625-A1.23596.486Brassica parent. To reproduce effectively, however, the male parent of the F1 hybrid must have a fertility restorer gene (Rf gene). The presence of a Rf gene means that the F1 generation will not be completely or partially sterile, so that either self-pollination or cross pollination may occur. Self pollination of the F1 generation to produce several subsequent generations is important to ensure that a desired trait is heritable and stable and that a new variety has been isolated.

US-20060294625-A1.24845.389 For most traits the true genotypic value may be masked by other confounding plant traits or environmental factors. One method for identifying a superior plant is to observe its performance relative to other experimental plants and to one or more widely grown standard lines. If a single observation is inconclusive, replicated observations provide a better estimate of the genetic worth. 
US-20060294625-A1.25234.1091 A breeder uses various methods to help determine which plants should be selected from the segregating populations and ultimately which lines will be used for commercialization. In addition to the knowledge of the germplasm and other skills the breeder uses, a part of the selection process is dependent on experimental design coupled with the use of statistical analysis. Experimental design and statistical analysis are used to help determine which plants, which family of plants, and finally which lines are significantly better or different for one or more traits of interest. Experimental design methods are used to control error so that differences between two lines can be more accurately determined. Statistical analysis includes the calculation of mean values, determination of the statistical significance of the sources of variation, and the calculation of the appropriate variance components. Five and one percent significance levels are customarily used to determine whether a difference that occurs for a given trait is real or is due to the environment or experimental error. 
US-20060294625-A1.26325.833 Proper testing should detect any major faults and establish the level of superiority or improvement over current lines. In addition to showing superior performance, there must be a demand for a new line that is compatible with industry standards or which creates a new market. The introduction of a new line commonly will incur additional costs to the seed producer, the grower, the processor and the consumer, for special advertising and marketing, altered seed and commercial production practices, and new product utilization. The testing preceding release of a new line should take into consideration research and development costs as well as technical superiority of the final line. For seed-propagated lines, it must be feasible to produce seed easily and economically. Preferably residual heterozygosity should not exceed 5%. 
US-20060294625-A1.27158.444 These processes, which lead to the final step of marketing and distribution, usually take approximately six to twelve years from the time the first cross is made. Therefore, the development of new lines such as that of the present invention is a time-consuming process that requires precise forward planning, efficient use of resources, and a minimum of changes in direction. Accordingly, significant technical human intervention is required. 
US-20060294625-A1.27602.429 Further, as a result of the advances in sterility systems, lines are developed that can be used as an open pollinated variety (i.e., a pureline cultivar sold to the grower for planting) and/or as a sterile inbred (female) used in the production of F1 hybrid seed. In the latter case, favorable combining ability with a restorer (male) would be desirable. The resulting hybrid seed would then be sold to the grower for planting. 
US-20060294625-A1.28031.995 Hybrid seed production of canola can be achieved using cytoplasmic male sterility. This type of hybrid production uses 3 inbred lines: a restorer line, an A line, and a B line. The restorer line, also called the R line, is used as the male in hybrid seed production. The restorer line has dominant nuclear genes, known as restorer genes, that are responsible for hybrid fertility. The R line is crossed to the A line to produce the F1 hybrid seed. The A line is male-sterile due to the cytoplasm and due to nonrestorer alleles in the nuclear genome. Because the A line is male sterile it cannot reproduce by itself. To reproduce the A line, a B line is developed. The B line, also called the maintainer line, is the genetic equivalent to the A line except that the B line has a normal cytoplasm and is therefore male fertile. The A line is pollinated by the B line. The seed developed on the A line plants is harvested and its progeny are crossed with the R line to produce the F1 hybrid seed. 
US-20060294625-A1.29026.976 The development of a canola hybrid in a canola plant breeding program involves three steps: (1) the selection of plants from various germplasm pools for initial breeding crosses; (2) the selfing of the selected plants from the breeding crosses for several generations to produce a series of inbred lines, which, although different from each other, breed true and are highly uniform; and (3) crossing the selected inbred lines with different inbred lines to produce the hybrids. During the inbreeding process in canola, the vigor of the lines decreases. Vigor is restored when two different inbred lines are crossed to produce the hybrid. An important consequence of the homozygosity and homogeneity of the inbred lines is that the hybrid between a defined pair of inbreds will always be the same. Once the inbreds that give a superior hybrid have been identified, the hybrid seed can be reproduced indefinitely as long as the homogeneity of the inbred parents is maintained. 
US-20060294625-A1.30002.631 Combining ability of a line, as well as the performance of the line per se, is a factor in the selection of improved canola lines that may be used as inbreds. Combining ability refers to a line's contribution as a parent when crossed with other lines to form hybrids. The hybrids formed for the purpose of selecting superior lines are designated test crosses. One way of measuring combining ability is by using breeding values. Breeding values are based on the overall mean of a number of test crosses. This mean is then adjusted to remove environmental effects and it is adjusted for known genetic relationships among the lines. 
US-20060294625-A1.30633.994 Hybrid seed production requires inactivation of pollen produced by the female parent. Incomplete inactivation of the pollen provides the potential for self-pollination. This inadvertently self-pollinated seed may be unintentionally harvested and packaged with hybrid seed. Similarly, because the male parent is grown next to the female parent in the field there is also the potential that the male selfed seed could be unintentionally harvested and packaged with the hybrid seed. Once the seed from the hybrid bag is planted, it is possible to identify and select these self-pollinated plants. These self-pollinated plants will be genetically equivalent to one of the inbred lines used to produce the hybrid. Though the possibility of inbreds being included in hybrid seed bags exists, the occurrence is rare because much care is taken to avoid such inclusions. These self-pollinated plants can be identified and selected by one skilled in the art, either through visual or molecular methods. 
US-20060294625-A1.31627.448Brassica napus canola plants, without any male sterility or self incompatibility system, are recognized to commonly be self-fertile with approximately 70 to 90 percent of the seed normally forming as the result of self-pollination. The percentage of cross pollination may be further enhanced when populations of recognized insect pollinators at a given growing site are greater. Thus open pollination is often used in commercial canola production.

US-20060294625-A1.38309.921 The SSDI rating for trials, after adjustment for incidence, is further adjusted by taking into account the severity of the disease. Therefore, after adjusting the SSDI % as previously explained, SSDS adjustments are made as well. The mean SSDS on infected plants of checks (scores of 1-8) is compared with that of the experimental entry. If the mean SSDS score was better on the experimental line (for example a rating of 3 on the checks versus 4 on the experimental line) the SSDI % was adjusted by multiplying by ¾. For example, if the SSDI % of the experimental line was 20%, ¾ multiplied by 20%=15%. This corresponds to a rating of 7.5 on the SSDI scale. Conversely, if the SSDS on the experimental entry was 2 (more affected) versus 3 on the checks, the SSDI % would be multiplied by 3/2. For example, if the SSDI % was 20%, multiplied by 3/2 would equal 30%. This corresponds to a rating of 6.0 on the SSDI scale.

US-20060294625-A1.45652.651 The target of the research effort was to replace fungicide treatment of canola with Sclerotinia-resistant varieties. The strategy was to use naturally available sources with partial resistance and pyramid these with disease-avoiding morphological traits through recurrent selection within a population, in order to attain a very high level of partial resistance. Once pyramided in a disease-avoiding background, resistance would be complete if it were built to sustain the maximum length of exposure to the disease, starting from petal drop to the end of flowering, and therefore would withstand the pathogen without significant damage to the plant. 
US-20060294625-A1.46303.755 Disease-avoiding morphological traits include, for example, good standability and stiff stalk (stem), later maturity, high branching, lower petal retention and rapid leaf abscission. Physiological traits are primarily strong partial stem resistance which may be associated with some leaf resistance. Thus, disease development which is reduced by morphological traits is further reduced where stem and/or leaf resistance is present. The overall impact of the fungus on the stem is decreased or minimized when a strong partial resistance in stems is combined with morphological traits that reduce the impact of the disease. In the absence of favorable morphological traits, overall performance is reduced but still significantly better than canola checks.

However, in natural trials in 2004 (Table 9), 44A89 is 232% of 46A76 and 46A65 is 199% of 46A76. This clearly shows that 46A76 is a high standard for measurement of field resistance, especially under natural field conditions, in comparison with other canola checks. This also shows the difference between natural field results and extreme disease pressure field research results. Extreme disease pressure field research conditions challenge all genotypes and represent the worst-case scenario, i.e. that which occurs normally in only 1 to 2% of natural field environments. (See Table 3.) A line which performs well under these extreme conditions is expected to perform at least as well in a natural field environment.

For example, Tables 9b and 9c compare results obtained on control lines at North Dakota and Minnesota testing sites in 2001, 2003, and 2005. These sites are extraction of higher-disease-pressure sites, excluding data sets from years with trace levels of disease (Bradley, et al., 2006). The low level of disease incidence for 46A76 in 2005 (NDSU-Carrington) indicates that environmental conditions may have complicated the disease scoring as suggested by researcher Bob Hanson (NDSU). In this instance, excessive irrigation led to both excessive lodging on earlier lines and delayed maturity on later lines, favoring later-maturing lines such as 46A76. Tables 9b and 9c suggest that the data collected at the NDSU-Carrington 2005 site are inconsistent with that generated at the same site as well as Minnesota sites in two prior years (see also Bradley, et al., 2006).

US-20060294625-A1.60583.434 3. Attempt to grow a dense and healthy canola crop to promote disease development. Seed rates should be uniform. Precision planting is preferred, or plants can be thinned to a uniform number of plants. To promote disease development, consider using a windbreak by planting strips or additional passes and/or installing netting around or over the crop.  Favorable Environment/Irrigation/Back-Up Natural Infection                
US-20060294625-A1.61017.306Sclerotinia stem rot is environmentally-dependent and the presence of inoculum is not sufficient unless a favorable wet or humid microenvironment is established within the crop. The relative success of infection is measured by the degree to which the susceptible checks are affected within the experiment. 
US-20060294625-A1.61323.446 As natural infection is seldom reliable or uniform, irrigation systems are used to promote disease development. Irrigation may be initiated as soon as the crop produces an enclosed canopy so that the canopy can retain moisture. Before the onset of flowering, the goal is to keep the topsoil wet and condition the sclerotia for germination to enable the development of apothecia in order to produce ascospores for the colonization of the petals. 
US-20060294625-A1.61769.582 Once the petals are colonized, the goal is to enable the progression of the disease to the leaves and stems after sufficient petal drop. This transfer occurs naturally in years with prolonged wet or humid conditions. Leaf wetness sensors regulate moisture in the canopy by triggering irrigation when the canopy is dry. The transfer of disease can be inhibited with ground water (especially in lower temperatures) so, if feasible, use collected rainwater or deionized ground water. Moisture in the canopy is needed until stem infection on the susceptible checks is fully developed. 
US-20060294625-A1.62351.221 While the environment is important for disease development, attained disease incidence and severity are directly related to the timing of the following factors: favorable environment, growth stage and inoculum pressure.

US-20060294625-A1.62820.827 The percentage of infected plants and disease severity can be rated (Tables 2 and 15) once the targeted incidence and extent of stem symptoms have developed on susceptible and/or resistant checks. It is recommended to conduct one rating when the desired differentiation is attained. Subsequent ratings are less reliable as the results may be affected by the physical impact on the canopy and stand during the initial rating. The rating is adjusted relative to the effect that the symptoms may have on the yield of the affected plant. For example, girdling on the lower stem versus on the higher stem has more effect on yield. Affected side racemes will reduce yield in pods that are only on that raceme, while an affected main raceme will affect the pods on the whole plant. This is reflected in the SSDS score; see Table 15. 
US-20060294625-A1.63647.443 Number and position of rated plants per row or plot are to be determined relative to the plant and disease development within the experiment. Disease pressure tends to be most uniform in the middle of rows or plots. Atypical and small plants should be excluded from the count and preferably pulled out of the row prior to or at counting. Thinning early in the season would resolve this issue. If possible, outside plants should not be rated.

US-20060294625-A1.64994.439 Due to the fact that partial resistance is not dominant, it is necessary to have resistance in both the male and female inbreds involved in hybrid seed production. Thus, field resistant inbreds must be developed in female as well in male pools of genetic materials. Hybrid crops are known for higher yields compared to their inbred components due to heterosis based on the genetic distance between female and male components of a hybrid.

Tissue culture as well as microspore culture for regeneration of canola plants can be accomplished successfully. (Chuong, et al., (1985); Barsby, T.

US-20060294625-A1.69686.395 Numerous methods for plant transformation have been developed, including biological and physical plant transformation protocols. See, for example, Miki, et al. (1988). In addition, expression vectors and in vitro culture methods for plant cell or tissue transformation and regeneration of plants are available. See, for example, Evans, et al (1983), Binding (1985) and Weissbach, et al., 1988. 
US-20060294625-A1.70081.332 The most prevalent types of plant transformation involve the construction of an expression vector. Such a vector comprises a DNA sequence that contains a gene under the control of, or operatively linked to, a regulatory element, for example a promoter. The vector may contain one or more genes and one or more regulatory elements. 
US-20060294625-A1.70413.1043 A genetic trait which has been engineered into a particular canola plant using transformation techniques could be moved into another line using traditional breeding techniques that are well known in the plant breeding arts. For example, a backcrossing approach could be used to move a transgene from a transformed canola plant to an elite inbred line and the resulting progeny would comprise a transgene. Also, if an inbred line was used for the transformation then the transgenic plants could be crossed to a different line in order to produce a transgenic hybrid canola plant. As used herein, “crossing” can refer to a simple X by Y cross, or the process of backcrossing, depending on the context. Various genetic elements can be introduced into the plant genome using transformation. These elements include but are not limited to genes; coding sequences; inducible, constitutive, and tissue specific promoters; enhancing sequences; and signal and targeting sequences. See U.S. Pat. No. 6,222,101 which is herein incorporated by reference. 
US-20060294625-A1.71456.544 With transgenic plants according to the present invention, a foreign protein can be produced in commercial quantities. Thus, techniques for the selection and propagation of transformed plants, which are well understood in the art, yield a plurality of transgenic plants which are harvested in a conventional manner, and a foreign protein then can be extracted from a tissue of interest or from total biomass. Protein extraction from plant biomass can be accomplished by known methods which are discussed, for example, by Heney and Orr (1981). 
US-20060294625-A1.72000.855 A genetic map can be generated, primarily via conventional Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphisms (RFLP), Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) analysis, and Simple Sequence Repeats (SSR) which identifies the approximate chromosomal location of the integrated DNA molecule coding for the foreign protein. For exemplary methodologies in this regard, see Glick and Thompson (1993). Map information concerning chromosomal location is useful for proprietary protection of a subject transgenic plant. If unauthorized propagation is undertaken and crosses made with other germplasm, the map of the integration region can be compared to similar maps for suspect plants, to determine if the latter have a common parentage with the subject plant. Map comparisons could involve hybridizations, RFLP, PCR, SSR and sequencing, all of which are conventional techniques.

US-20060294627-A1.539.206 This invention is in the field of corn breeding, specifically relating to an inbred corn line designated G0502. This invention also is in the field of hybrid maize production employing the present inbred. 
US-20060294627-A1.745.721 The original maize plant was indigenous to the Western Hemisphere. The plants were weedlike and only through the efforts of early breeders were cultivated crop species developed. The crop cultivated by early breeders, like the crop today, could be wind pollinated. The physical traits of maize are such that wind pollination results in self-pollination or cross-pollination between plants. Each plant has a separate male and female flower that contributes to pollination, the tassel and ear, respectively. Natural pollination occurs when wind transfers pollen from tassel to the silks on the corn ears. This type of pollination has contributed to the wide variation of maize varieties present in the Western Hemisphere. 
US-20060294627-A1.1466.602 The development of a planned breeding program for maize only occurred in the last century. A large part of the development of the maize product into a profitable agricultural crop was due to the work done by land grant colleges. Originally, maize was an open pollinated variety having heterogeneous genotypes. The maize farmer selected uniform ears from the yield of these genotypes and preserved them for planting the next season. The result was a field of maize plants that were segregating for a variety of traits. This type of maize selection led to, at most, incremental increases in seed yield. 
US-20060294627-A1.2068.1305 Large increases in seed yield were due to the work done by land grant colleges that resulted in the development of numerous hybrid corn varieties in planned breeding programs. Hybrids were developed by selecting corn lines and selfing these lines for several generations to develop homozygous pure inbred lines. One selected inbred line was crossed with another selected inbred line to produce hybrid progeny (F1). The resulting hybrids, due to heterosis, are robust and vigorous plants. Inbreds on the other hand are mostly homozygous. This homozygosity renders the inbred lines less vigorous. Inbred seed can be difficult to produce since the inbreeding process in corn lines decreases the vigor. However, when two inbred lines are crossed, the hybrid plant evidences greatly increased vigor and seed yield compared to open pollinated, segregating maize plants. An important consequence of the homozygosity and the homogenity of the inbred maize lines is that all hybrid seed produced from any cross of two such elite lines will be the same hybrid seed and make the same hybrid plant. Thus the use of inbreds makes hybrid seed which can be reproduced readily. The hybrid plant in contrast does not produce hybrid seed that is readily reproducible. The seed on a hybrid plant is segregating for traits. 
US-20060294627-A1.3373.813 The ultimate objective of the commercial maize seed companies is to produce high yielding, agronomically sound plants that perform well in certain regions or areas of the Corn Belt. To produce these types of hybrids, the companies must develop inbreds, which carry needed traits into the hybrid combination. Hybrids are not often uniformly adapted for the entire Corn Belt, but most often are specifically adapted for regions of the Corn Belt. Northern regions of the Corn Belt require shorter season hybrids than do southern regions of the Corn Belt. Hybrids that grow well in Colorado and Nebraska soils may not flourish in richer Illinois and Iowa soil. Thus, a variety of major agronomic traits are important in hybrid combination for the various Corn Belt regions, and have an impact on hybrid performance. 
US-20060294627-A1.4186.3762 population produced from a planned cross of two genotypes (often elite inbred lines), or selection of progeny of synthetic varieties, open pollinated, composite, or backcrossed populations. This type of selection is effective for highly inheritable traits, but other traits, for example, yield requires replicated test crosses at a variety of stages for accurate selection. 
US-20060294627-A1.4562.1010 Maize breeders select for a variety of traits in inbreds that impact hybrid performance along with selecting for acceptable parental traits. Such traits include: yield potential in hybrid combination; dry down; maturity; grain moisture at harvest; greensnap; resistance to root lodging; resistance to stalk lodging; grain quality; disease and insect resistance; ear and plant height. Additionally, Hybrid performance will differ in different soil types such as low levels of organic matter, clay, sand, black, high pH, low pH; or in different environments such as wet environments, drought environments, and no tillage conditions. These traits appear to be governed by a complex genetic system that makes selection and breeding of an inbred line extremely difficult. Even if an inbred in hybrid combination has excellent yield (a desired characteristic), it may not be useful because it fails to have acceptable parental traits such as seed yield, seed size, pollen production, good silks, plant height, etc. 
US-20060294627-A1.5572.3082 generation that segregates for traits and selecting progeny with the visual traits desired does not easily lead to a useful inbred. Great care and breeder expertise must be used in selection of breeding material to continue to increase yield and the agronomics of inbreds and resultant commercial hybrids. 
US-20060294627-A1.5880.898 Certain regions of the Corn Belt have specific difficulties that other regions may not have. Thus the hybrids developed from the inbreds have to have traits that overcome or at least minimize these regional growing problems. Examples of these problems include in the eastern corn belt Gray Leaf Spot, in the north cool temperatures during seedling emergence, in the Nebraska region CLN (corn Lethal necrosis and in the west soil that has excessively high pH levels. The industry often targets inbreds that address these issues specifically forming niche products. However, the aim of most large seed producers is to provide a number of traits to each inbred so that the corresponding hybrid can useful in a broader regions of the Corn Belt. The new biotechnology techniques such as Microsatellites, RFLPs, RAPDs and the like have provided breeders with additional tools to accomplish these goals.

US-20060294627-A1.18914.965 The use of pollen, cotyledons, meristems and ovum as the target issue can eliminate the need for extensive tissue culture work. Generally, cells derived from meristematic tissue are useful. Zygotic embryos can also be used. Additionally, the method of transformation of meristematic cells of cereal is also taught in the PCT application WO96/04392. Any of the various cell lines, tissues, plants and plant parts can and have been transformed by those having knowledge in the art. Methods of preparing callus or protoplasts from various plants are well known in the art and specific methods are detailed in patents and references used by those skilled in the art. Cultures can be initiated from most of the above-identified tissue. The only true requirement of the transforming material is that it can form a transformed plant. The transgenic gene can come from various non-plant genes (such as; bacteria, yeast, animals, and viruses) along with being from plants. 
US-20060294627-A1.19879.635 The DNA used for transformation of these plants clearly may be circular, linear, and double or single stranded. Usually, the DNA is in the form of a plasmid. The plasmid usually contains regulatory and/or targeting sequences which assists the expression of the gene in the plant. The methods of forming plasmids for transformation are known in the art. Plasmid components can include such items as: leader sequences, transit polypeptides, promoters, terminators, genes, introns, marker genes, etc. The structures of the gene orientations can be sense, antisense, partial antisense, or partial sense: multiple gene copies can be used. 
US-20060294627-A1.20514.454 The regulatory promoters employed can be constitutive such as CaMv35S (usually for dicots) and polyubiquitin for monocots or tissue specific promoters such as CAB promoters, etc. The prior art includes but is not limited to octopine synthase, nopaline synthase, CaMv19S, mannopine synthase promoters. These regulatory sequences can be combined with introns, terminators, enhancers, leader sequences and the like in the material used for transformation.

The improvements in transformation technology are beginning to eliminate the need to regenerate plants from cells. Since 1986, the transformation of pollen has been published and recently the transformation of plant meristems has been published. The transformation of ovum, pollen, and seedlings meristem greatly reduce the difficulties associated with cell regeneration of different plants or genotypes which a maize plant can present. Duncan, from at least 1985 produced literature on plant regeneration from callus. Both inbred and hybrid callus have resulted in regenerated plants. Somatic embryogenesis has been performed on various maize tissues, which was once considered unusable for this purpose. The prior art clearly teaches the regeneration of plants from various maize tissues. 
US-20060294627-A1.21897.361 The most common method of maize transformation is referred to as gunning or microprojectile bombardment though the other methods can be used. The Biolistic process has small gold-coated particles coated with DNA shot into the transformable material. Techniques for gunning DNA into cells, tissue, callus, embryos, and the like are well known in the prior art.

In many cases, a selectable marker identifies the transformed material. The putatively transformed material is exposed to a toxic agent at varying concentrations. The cells not transformed with the selectable marker, which provides resistance to this toxic agent, die. Cells or tissues containing the resistant selectable marker generally proliferate. It has been noted that although selectable markers protect the cells from some of the toxic affects of the herbicide or antibiotic, the cells may still be slightly affected by the toxic agent by having slower growth rates. If the transformed material was cell lines then these lines are regenerated into plants. The cells' lines are treated to induce tissue differentiation. Methods of regeneration of cellular maize material are well known in the art.
