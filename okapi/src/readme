This is the key readme file needed when getting okapi source from the
source repository.

To build this, you will need:

- java 1.6.0 or higher
- gcc 3.4.6 or higher
- bison 2.3 or higher
- flex 2.5.33 or higher

A few simple commands will build okapi completely -- including the JNI logic.
A few files to make not of are the site.h file (which you may need to configure
for your own machine you're building on) and the Makefile. Paricularly the
line in the Makefile containing:

 CC = gcc -g -march=i586 -ffast-math

These are the primary compile options. The -g option is good for debugging
(as that option sets up all the debugging libraries), while the -march
and -ffast-math I think should probably be removed in the future. Not sure
what benefit these options give us.

1.  Build java classes

  javac *.java

2. Create the newest JNI jar file, which packages the classes created.
   (see readme-java for details)

  jar cfm OkapiJNI.jar Manifest.txt *.class

3. Build the okapi bss

  make
